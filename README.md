# MYROUTES

### Â¿What is myroutes?

myroutes is an application which at the beginning will generate predetermined routes of various types that can be gastronomic, cultural, leisure or the combination of some or all of them. To use the application users will have to register. As the first users make the first steps of the route, we can monitor the route they make, and study the profile of users they are.With which, when another user with a similar profile starts the same route, we can suggest these new ones sites. In addition, to automatically generate routes you can also keep track of upcoming events to take into account (especially in the cultural and gastronomic section.) Or, we can see where and when there are more people somewhere, either a new restaurant or a new fashionable town, in order to be able to add it to our routes. Different places or things will also be proposed depending on the place where we are typical food of the place, famous monuments ...

Conclusion:

The application will be a utility when you do not know what to do or where to go. You will always be looking for new alternatives to entertain the user and that he always has something to do or somewhere to go based on his profile.


### How we differ?

Our application stands out for being as close as possible to the user, trying to offer the user what they are looking for without having to ask for it or waste time.
If this user follows the route the application will send notifications with the monuments and their details and history, in addition the routes will be modified during, said route either, for detours to eat or to make the route more direct or adding suggestions taking into account that they have made the previous users who have made the route and have a similar profile
In turn, the application will send notifications during the days before holidays or weekends with different routes and photos of the most beautiful places on that route for the user to plan to make these plans.
The application will be able to know when you leave your routine to be able to send you notifications
